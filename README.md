Finder Of XSS and Dal is the Korean pronunciation of moon.

## What is DalFox
Just, XSS Scanning and Parameter Analysis tool. I previously developed [XSpear](https://github.com/hahwul/XSpear), a Ruby-based XSS tool, and this time, a full change occurred during the process of porting with golang and created it as a new project. The basic concept is to analyze parameters, find XSS, and examine them based on Selenium.

I talk about naming. Dal(ë‹¬) is the Korean pronunciation of moon and fox was made into Fox(Finder Of XSS).

## Key features

- Paramter Analysis (find refleced, bypass pattern, mining params with small fuzzing)
- Static Analysis (detect WAF, detect CSP, mining params with response base)
- XSS Scanning (common, bypassing pattern, polyglot)
  - common payload, custom payload , blind xss , etc..)
  - WAF, CSP Bypassing
- Support Pipeline 
  - Sacnning from IO
  - Scanning from Raw file(Burp suite, ZAP Request)
